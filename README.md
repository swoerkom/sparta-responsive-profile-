**Task:** To edit an unresponsive CSS layout and add CSS media queries to make the website accessible from all screen widths and devices. To make sure that the page has two noticably different layouts at different screen widths.


Used media queries to select div elements and make width 100% so that at selected screen sizes the elements would stack on top of each other by taking up the full width of the page. Also made headshot image smaller when screen size was reduced. Created two break points, so that the website layout was accessible for mobile, tablet and desktop view.
